            <h3>To start cooking Pinirito(Fried) na isda, we must first take notice on the list of materials and ingredients needed to make the most delicious and perfect fish!
            </h3>
            <ul class = "Frying-Steps">
                <h4>Materials needed:</h4>
                <li>Frying Pan</li>
                <li>Container for the Fish</li>
                <li>Rerigerator</li>
                <li>Spatula (spoon or fork will also do)</li>
                <li>Serving Plate</li>
                <li>Faucet </li>
                <li>Stove</li>

                <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <li>1 or more Fish (this works for all types of fish)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt (each fish)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of pepper (each fish)</li>

                <h1>For the steps:</h1>
                <li>Step 1: Get your fish from the refrigerator (if necessary)</li>
                <li>Step 2: Cleanse the fish; remove its scales, blood, and gills under the faucet, then store it back in its container.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Season the fish with ½ teaspoon of salt. Spread it thoroughly and evenly throughout the whole fish and both of its sides.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Season the fish with ½ teaspoon of pepper for more taste. Thoroughly and evenly spread it throughout the whole fish and both of its sides.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Get your frying pan ready. Cleanse it thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Step 6: Get ready the stove and heat up the frying pan. Leave it there for about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 7: Place around 2 tablespoons of oil on the frying pan. Leave it for about a minute.</li>
                <li>Step 8: Now, place the fish slowly in the oil. Lower the fish slowly but surely to make sure you do not get sprinkled by the oil. </li>
                <li>Step 9: Wait until one side of the fish is golden brown. Do not touch the fish during the waiting process. This can be quick as 5 minutes or even as long as 20 minutes; watch carefully. </li>
                <li>Step 10: Once the side is golden brown, you can now flip the fish. Wait until the other side becomes golden brown.</li>
                <li>Step 11: Once the other side becomes golden brown, congratulations! Your fish is now cooked! Now grab the fish by its bottom and slowly bring it over to your plate and it is now ready to serve!</li>
                <li>Step 12: Now, turn off the stove. Bring the frying pan under the faucet and soak it in the sink.</li>
                <li>Step 13: For your fish container, cleanse all the remaining blood and soak it in the sink.</li>
                <li>Step 14: You can now add your favorite sauces and toppings on your fish if you want. Bon Appetit!</li>

                <h4>My Evaluations and Ratings:</h4>
                <p>In my opinion, this Filipino dish is the quickest to make among our examples and cooking this can save a lot of time whenever you are in a rush. Based from my experience, this is usually my go-to dish during the times that there is no food set on the table. The versability of this dish makes it even more interesting as you can combine it with other types of foods like rice, pasta, nuts, and even vegetables. The downside of this dish, however, is that it lacks the taste that our other dishes may serve. In addition to that, fried foods such as these are shown to be rich in saturated fat and trans fat which are associated with a higher risk of developing heart problems (Reisdorf, 2021).  Overall, I can say this dish deserves a 7/10. </p>
