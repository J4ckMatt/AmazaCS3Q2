            <h3>To start cooking Sinugba(Grilled) na isda, we must first take notice on the list of materials and ingredients needed to make the most delicious and perfect fish!
            </h3>
            <ul class = "Grilling-steps">
                <h4>Materials needed:</h4>
                <li>Grilling stove (or kalan with uling)</li>
                <li>Aluminum foil (optional)</li>
                <li>Fish container</li>
                <li>refrigerator</li>
                <li>Spatula (spoon or fork will also do)</li>
                <li>Serving Plate</li>
                <li>Faucet</li>

                <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <li>1 or more Fish (this works for all types of fish)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>

                <h1>For the Steps:</h1>
                <li>Step 1: Get your fish from the refrigerator (if necessary)</li>
                <li>Step 2: Cleanse the fish; remove its scales, blood, and gills under the faucet, then store it back in its container.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Season the fish with Â½ teaspoon of salt. Spread it thoroughly and evenly throughout the whole fish and both of its sides.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Get your cooking pot ready. Make sure it is all cleansed and sanitized.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Wrap the fish in aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Step 6A (For those using aluminum foil): Get ready the grilling stove and heat up the grills for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 7A: Now place the wrapped fish on the grills. Check from time to time whether one side of the fish starts to smell cooked or whether the side becomes soft, has the slimy texture, and easily pulled.</li>
                <li>Step 6B (For those who have no aluminum foil): Get ready the grilling stove and heat up the grills for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 7B: Now place the fish on the grills. Check from time to time whether the fish becomes easily picked up from the grills. Once it is, you will know that that side is cooked.</li>
                <li>Step 8: Flip the fish and look out for signs the other side is cooked (based from the previous steps).</li>
                <li>Step 9: Once the other side is cooked, congratulations! You just made yourself the most delicious Sinugba (grilled) na isda! Now grab the fish by its bottom and slowly bring it over to your plate and it is now ready to serve!</li>
                <li>Step 10: Now, slowly turn off the stove. Cleanse the grills and soak it in the sink.</li>
                <li>Step 11: You can now add your favorite sauces and toppings on your fish if you want. Bon Appetit!</li>

                <h4>My Evaluations and Ratings:</h4>
                <p>In my opinion, this Filipino dish is best made when you have a lot of visitors and they are a huge fan of fish. Grilling the fish is one of the healthiest ways to cook fish as it limits the loss of healthy omega-3 fats, and preserves the essential nutrients fish can provide, as well as it limits the formation of harmful chemical compounds, according to West (2017). The versability of this dish makes it even more interesting as you can combine it with other types of foods like rice, pasta, nuts, and even vegetables. The only downside of this dish, however, is that it lacks the taste that our other dishes may serve. In addition, this way of cooking fish takes the longest out of all the other types of cooking methods we have here. Overall, I can give this fish a 7/10.</p>
