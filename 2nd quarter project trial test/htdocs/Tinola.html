                <h4>My Evaluations and ratings</h4>
                <p>In my opinion, this way of cooking fish is one of the best in terms of taste out of all the cooking methods we have here. These are the types of dishes you would want during a family dinner as it is rich in vegetables. This is what your parents would want you to be eating. This type of dish and cooking method is not only exclusive to Fish, however. You can also use this cooking method and other meats as well such as chicken and turkey! The downside of this cooking method, however, is that it requires a lot of preparation time and a lot of materials compared to other cooking methods that we have. Overall, I could give this an 8/10.</p>
